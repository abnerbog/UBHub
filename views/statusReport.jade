        div [CITY]
        div [REPORT DATE]

        img(src="/images/UBHub_logo_mainwebsite.png")
        div(class="spaceBelow") This report has been automatically generated from data entered into the indicator tracker on www.ubhub.com. This data has been managed by [USER] on behalf of [ORGANIZATION].

        div(class="spaceBelow") The Urban Biodiversity Inventory Framework (UBIF) is a standardized system for local governments to measure the status of biodiversity in an urban environment. It was first developed in 2017 in a partnership effort under the Urban Sustainability Directors Network (USDN). In the UBIF system, adherents choose surrogate species which will serve as proxy indicators for biodiversity status. They will also indicate particular places within which to track these species. Data is then tracked by taxonomic group and habitat type over time to measure progress.

        div(class="spaceBelow") Adherents to UBIF can select from three different methods, or “tracks”.  Track 2, used here, calls for species observations to include both presence and absence data for each habitat type. Adherents to UBIF Track 2 set goals for the presence of surrogate species in each habitat and taxon and track their progress over time.

        div(class="underline") Section 1: Overview of Surrogate Species
        div(class="spaceBelow") Data has been tracked for [CITY] beginning in [YEAR]. Current data aggregates observations made from [DATE] to [DATE].
