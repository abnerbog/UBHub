        div(style="color:white; padding-right:100px; padding-left:100px; padding-bottom:5px;") The Urban Biodiversity Hub (UBHub) helps cities around the world to measure and promote their biodiversity and assess their biodiversity strategy. We work with municipal and other local governments and their partners to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their biodiversity planning, according to the goals they set for themselves. We do this by consolidating information on urban biodiversity planning activities and guides in one website, and through our forum and other resources pages which provide access to the latest practices for urban biodiversity planning.

    div(style="display:flex")
      div(style="padding:10px")
        | Our immediate goal is to create a web tool for local governments (cities) to measure their biodiversity and assess their biodiversity strategy. In the long term, we are looking to promote biodiversity awareness and action within and around cities due to future urban issues.

        | Our team formed in December of 2016 at the 13th Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity. We came together out of mutual interest in promoting measurable biodiversity actions in cities around the world. We have since built an international organizational structure that is maintained via regular online meetings and reliance on the latest in remote team management tools.
        | Our team consists of volunteers from around the world. Some are professionals in biodiversity, conservation policy, or web development, and others are passionate to learn and make a difference. We have representatives all around the world, allowing us to serve the specific regional needs and contributing in the development of best practices for urban biodiversity strategies.

            p Docteur en sciences sociales à l'Université de Sassari, en Italie. Ses premiers sujets de recherche étaient centrés sur l'inégalité urbaine, les problèmes socio-urbains et les politiques publiques. En 2015, elle a commencé un doctorat en aménagement et urbanisme, à Paris, au Laboratoire Architecture et Anthropologie (LAVUE UMR 7218). Elle travaille actuellement sur sa thèse qui porte sur les Mesures de la Biodiversité Urbaine. En 2016, elle a été visiting researcher au National Biodiversity Centre de Singapour pour étudier l'indice de biodiversité de la ville (CBI). Son intérêt pour la recherche porte également sur la possibilité de produire d'autres façon de mesurer la biodiversité, en essayant d'aller au-delà de la quantification.
