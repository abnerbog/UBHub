              <div style="padding:10px;"> <b>ABOUT US </b> <p> The City Biodiversity Indicators (CBI) Coalition helps cities around the world to measure and promote their biodiversity and assess their biodiversity strategy.  We work with municipal and other local governments and their partners to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their biodiversity planning, according to the goals they set for themselves.  We do this by consolidating information on urban biodiversity planning activities and guides in one website, and through our forum and other resources pages which provide access to the latest practices for urban biodiversity planning. </div>

            <p> Our short term goal is to create a web tool for local governments and communities to measure their biodiversity and assess their biodiversity strategy. In the long term, we are looking to promote biodiversity awareness and action within and around cities due to future urban issues. </div>

            CBI Coalition formed in December of 2016 at the 13th Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity. We came together out of mutual interest in promoting measurable biodiversity actions in cities around the world.  We have since built an international organizational structure that is maintained via regular online meetings and reliance on the latest in remote team management tools.

            Our team consists of volunteers from around the world. Some are professionals in biodiversity, conservation policy, or web development, and others are passionate to learn and make a difference.  We have all around the world representatives, allowing us to serve the specific regional needs therefore contributing in the development of best practices for urban biodiversity strategies. </div>
